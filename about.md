# About This Journal

The Actuarial Journal is my personal actuarial journal, where I share my understanding, learnings, and practical perspectives from working in the actuarial field. It is created for actuarial aspirants, students, and fellow professionals who wish to build strong conceptual clarity.

While every effort is made to ensure accuracy, this content reflects my personal interpretations and learning journey. Errors or oversights are possible, and I sincerely welcome readers to point out any mistakes, suggest corrections, or share alternative viewpoints. Constructive feedback is always appreciated.
