# The Actuarial Journal

Welcome to **The Actuarial Journal** — a structured knowledge hub dedicated to explaining actuarial science in a clear, practical, and accessible manner.

This journal is created for:
- Actuarial students and exam aspirants
- Early-career actuarial professionals
- Non-actuaries curious about the profession

> Actuarial science is not about complex mathematics alone — it is about understanding uncertainty and making responsible financial decisions.

*This journal reflects my personal learning and professional journey. Readers are encouraged to share feedback or corrections wherever appropriate.*
